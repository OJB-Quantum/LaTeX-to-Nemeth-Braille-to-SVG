# LaTeX-to-Nemeth-Braille-to-SVG
Generate an SVG output of mathematics and text in Braille format. 

> The original idea for this repository was initiated back in summer of 2024 as a part of exploration into how blind physicists like [Dr. Kent Cullers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Cullers) and [Aqil Sajjad](https://wp.optics.arizona.edu/sguha/aqil-sajjad/#:~:text=Aqil%20Sajjad%20has%20a%20PhD,entanglement%20in%20many%2Dbody%20systems.) learned and express terms in physics using Braille. Simultaneously, I thought it would be beneficial to gauge how people learn topics like quantum mechanics and quantum computing through Braille, as it would help in developing additional translation material for my [Navaho Linguistics](https://ojb-quantum.github.io/Navaho-Linguistics/) project.
